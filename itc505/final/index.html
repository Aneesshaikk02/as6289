            <h2>Addendum: The Making of "Revenge of Lights Out"</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to "Revenge of Lights Out," a modern twist on the classic Lights Out game. In this section, I'll share some insights into the development process and the creative decisions made along the way.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Philosophy:</h3>
            <p>
                - <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> I opted for a soothing light green background to evoke a sense of calmness and concentration for players.<br>
                - <strong>Layout:</strong> Utilizing flexbox, I centered the game container both vertically and horizontally for a polished presentation across devices.
            </p>

            <h3>Exciting Features:</h3>
            <p>
                - <strong>Timer Challenge:</strong> Challenge yourself against the clock with our integrated timer that starts upon game initiation and stops upon successful completion.<br>
                - <strong>New Game Button:</strong> Want to reset the board and try again? Simply hit the "New Game" button for a fresh start.
            </p>

            <h3>Overcoming Obstacles:</h3>
            <p>
                - <strong>Styling Dilemmas:</strong> Striking a balance between aesthetics and responsiveness posed challenges. Through meticulous use of flexbox and color palettes, we achieved a harmonious design.<br>
                - <strong>Timer Implementation:</strong> Crafting a reliable timer system required meticulous interval management. Our startTimer and resetTimer functions ensure accurate timing throughout gameplay.<br>
                - <strong>User Interaction:</strong> Ensuring intuitive user controls while maintaining game integrity was paramount. The "Start Game" and "New Game" buttons provide seamless interaction for players of all levels.
            </p>

            <h3>Insights and Reflections:</h3>
            <p>
                - Modular Coding: Employing modular functions enhanced code readability and ease of maintenance.<br>
                - Iterative Development: Iterative testing and refinement were pivotal in crafting a seamless user experience.<br>
                - Community Feedback: Valuable insights from user feedback drove continuous improvements and optimizations.
